# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using Unity. The game features a user interface where players can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors and then click "Shoot" to see if they win against a randomly chosen move by the computer. The game also includes a replay feature to reset and play again.
